# Activate SENA Controller v3.0

**SENA Controller v3.0 is being activated...**

Activation happens silently in the background. Claude will:
1. Load all 24 SENA innovations
2. Initialize 5 cognitive engines
3. Enable Beautiful UI system
4. Activate all genius methodologies

No visible output needed - SENA works transparently.

After activation, use `/sena-status` to see the dashboard (displayed cleanly in text, no Bash commands).
