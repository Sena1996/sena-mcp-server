# Verify Truth (Anti-Hallucination System)

I will verify the truth of any statement using SENA's Truth Verification system with anti-hallucination filters.

**What this checks:**
- ✓ Truth level (Axiomatic, Proven, Verified, Probable, Speculative, Unverified, False)
- ✓ Confidence score (0-100%)
- ✓ Hallucination patterns (fake statistics, vague authority, weasel words)
- ✓ Logical fallacies (circular reasoning, false dichotomy, appeal to authority, etc.)
- ✓ First principles verification

**Usage:** Provide the statement to verify after the command
