# First Principles Thinking (Newton's Method)

I will decompose your problem to first principles using Newton's Principia Mathematica methodology.

**This applies:**
- ✓ Axiomatic reasoning (30 fundamental axioms)
- ✓ Mathematical rigor
- ✓ Proof verification
- ✓ No logical leaps
- ✓ Build from foundation up

**Usage:** /first-principles <your problem>

Now applying first principles:
