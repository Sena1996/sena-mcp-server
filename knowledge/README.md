## 🎯 How to Use These

### In Claude Desktop (MCP)

Access via MCP resources:

```
Show me SENA security patterns for authentication

Reference SENA reasoning frameworks for root cause analysis

Use SENA performance patterns for database optimization

Apply SENA architecture patterns to this design problem
```

### In Claude Code CLI

Reference automatically via CLAUDE.md rules:

```
# Knowledge bases are already loaded in your session
# via ~/.claude/memory/ references

Ask: "Analyze this using first principles thinking"
Ask: "What security patterns should I use for authentication?"
Ask: "How can I optimize this database query?"
Ask: "What architecture pattern fits this requirement?"
```
